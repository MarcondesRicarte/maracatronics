This is the central AI software of Tigers Mannheim called Sumatra.
In order to build and run it, it is recommended to use Eclipse. 
However, it "should" also be possible to build it with Maven.

System Requirements
 * Java JDK 7 (or JDK 8 with Eclipse Luna)
 * no limitations on OS known
 * recommended: opencl drivers and a GPU (there are fall-back algorithm though)

Running Sumatra with Eclipse is as easy as importing it to your workspace and simply press Run.
It should automatically use the shared launch config. 
The main class containing the main-method is called "Sumatra.java".
You can find it using Ctrl+Shift+T.

We also provide a modified version of grSim (original: https://github.com/mani-monaj/grSim).
It is published in the same way as Sumatra.
You should be able to run AI against AI within one Sumatra instance.
Make sure you configure "moduli_sim", "botmanager_sim" and "RoboCup_2014" in the menu bar.
You might need to change some network parameters. 
For this, stop Sumatra and modify /Sumatra/config/moduli/moduli_sim.xml
and /Sumatra/config/botmanager/botmanager_sim.xml.
